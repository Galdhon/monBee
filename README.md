# monBee
An Ethersphere Bee node monitor written in JavaScript for node.js

monBee requires nodejs and npm packages (well, npm only to get the following)

monBee uses blessed for drawing its TUI (Text User Interface)

monBee uses axios to communicate to bee's Debug API (to be converted to bee-js)


So, to get it running the following commands, or their equivalents, should work:

sudo apt-get install nodejs

sudo apt-get install npm

npm i should install the needed dependencies.

Note: This is my first-ever github repository and public release of an open-source project.  I am NOT a JavaScript programmer, but ported my lua/moai code to node.js so that it can be more easily used (and hopefully expanded) by others.
